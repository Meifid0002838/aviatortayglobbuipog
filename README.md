## Aviator Game Guide

Now that you\'ve successfully downloaded Aviator, let\'s dive into the
game mechanics and gameplay. Understanding the basics will help you
navigate the game with confidence and maximize your winning potential.

### Gameplay

Aviator features a simple yet captivating gameplay:

1.  Place your bet before the plane takes off.
2.  Once the plane starts its ascent, the multiplier will begin to
    increase.
3.  Click the "Cash Out" button to collect your winnings at any
    point during the flight.
4.  If the plane flies away before you cash out, you lose your bet.

### Objective

The objective of Aviator is to cash out before the plane flies away. The
longer the plane flies, the higher the multiplier, increasing your
potential winnings. However, it\'s crucial to time your cash out
carefully to avoid losing your bet if the plane crashes.

### Strategies

While there\'s no guaranteed winning strategy, there are several
approaches you can consider:

-   **Conservative Approach:** Cash out early with a smaller multiplier
    to minimize risk.
-   **Aggressive Approach:** Wait for higher multipliers before cashing
    out, potentially earning significant winnings if the plane flies
    long enough.
-   **Martingale Strategy:** Double your bet after each loss, betting on
    the assumption that the plane will eventually fly long enough for
    you to recover your losses and make a profit.
